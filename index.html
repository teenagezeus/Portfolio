  <h1>Hello! My name is Sandile Masuku. I'm a freelance software developer.</h1>
  <p>I've been coding object oriented programs since 2020. I'm a beginner fresh out of high school and as such have no working experience but I will let my projects speak for themselves. I have worked in web design(HTML, CSS & JS) as well as programing(Java & Python). In my free time I enjoy going on walks, spending time with friends and watching anime.</p>
